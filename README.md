> **For the first time, the future itself becomes an asset that can be minted, traded, and given liquidity.**

## What is Omenet?

Omenet is a protocol where future events become on-chain assets.  
Instead of betting on predefined outcomes, Omenet allows anyone to **define, mint, and trade probabilistic models of the future**.

In Omenet, markets no longer ask *what will happen*.  
They decide **which version of the future deserves to happen**.

Every event is minted as an asset, priced by market consensus, and contested through liquidity and trade.

## Why Omenet Exists

Traditional prediction markets treat the future as a question.  
Omenet treats the future as **a construct**.

Rather than waiting for reality to arrive, Omenet brings future logic into the present — where it can be priced, traded, and challenged.  
Belief becomes economic weight.  
Consensus becomes liquidity.  
And the future becomes programmable.
